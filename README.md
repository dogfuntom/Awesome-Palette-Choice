# How to use generated/choosen palettes in UI
If your intention is UI and you're not already a designer, **please do not ignore these general** advices. They take only 5 minutes (each), have high signal/noise ratio and have no annoyances (ads):
* [Building Your Color Palette](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/) — Explains how to not end up with [UI that look like this](https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-02.png).

# Automatic
Palettes are generated automagically or with AI. Importantly, usually you still can (sometimes must) specify a color to force such tool to generate palettes around the provided color.
